# Financial Stock Market Prediction Using Jaya Algorithm Optimized Neural Networks

My project demonstrates how the two types of FLANN models i.e. (Functional link artificial neural network models ) like Chebyshev-FLANN (CFLANN) and Trigonometric-FLANN (TFLANN) are trained using Jaya algorithm to predict the Stock Market Indices.
The intention of this project is putting forward a contrast between popular training algorithms such as Back Propagation (BP) and Jaya algorithm. The BP and Jaya algorithm trained FLANN models are examined for predicting stock indices for one day and a week ahead.
The stock indices BSE500, DJIA and NASDAQ with few technical indicators are taken as inputs in this experimental time series data. The study confirms the superiority of Jaya algorithm trained FLANN models to the traditional BP trained FLANN models and amongst all the models jaya trained TFLANN model is outperforming. The Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are used for performance evaluation. The simulation study is done using python 3 in Anaconda environment.

## Usage

1 day ahead and 1 week ahead stock market prediction can be done.

Users can opt for any stock data from https://finance.yahoo.com/ can fix the length of the training and testing samples as per their requirements and predict stock market for one day and one week ahead.
